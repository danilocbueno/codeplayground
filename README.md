Code Playground - Question Type Moodle Plugin
----------------------
The Code Playground question type allows real-time editing and viewing of HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes. So the student can insert his code and see the result immediately in the browser.

In addition to real-time visualization, Code Playground checks the code submitted by students through the W3C API for HTML and CSS.

From the results of the API's, the plugin calculates the score of the question by making a simple calculation removing 1% for each failure committed.
